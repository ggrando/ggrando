# Hello, I'm Grando! 👋

I'm an enthusiastic software development student currently studying for a postgraduate degree in Software Architecture at [FIAP](https://www.fiap.com.br/), delving into the intricacies of building robust and scalable systems.

🚀 I've been a part of the [RD Station](https://www.rdstation.com/) (TOTS3) team for 5 years now, a fantastic company in the realm of digital marketing and automation. I specialize in RD Station's REST APIs and love tackling new technological challenges.

Currently, I'm exploring the universe of Ruby on Rails, a powerful combination for web development. I'm also exploring the depths of AWS and navigating through the seas of Docker in my postgraduate.

You can find me on LinkedIn:

Let's connect there and exchange ideas! If you feel like chatting about tech, software, or just want to chat over a virtual cup of coffee, just hit me up over there. ☕

 I live on an island. It's the perfect place to brew some code with a view! 🏝️☕️
